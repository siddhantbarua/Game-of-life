Quick and dirty ASCII implementation of Conway's Game of Life.
Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automation game devised by British mathematician John Horton Conway. In the game, each cell in the universe is in one of two states: alive or dead. Every cell has 8 neighbours, which are its horizontally, vertically or diagonally adjacent cells. The game evolves through the following rules: 

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
